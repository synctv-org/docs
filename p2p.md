## What is P2P

P2P (Peer-to-Peer) is a network architecture where each node acts as both client and server. In a P2P network, nodes connect directly to each other and share resources like files and computing power without relying on centralized servers.

## Why P2P is Needed

When multiple users are watching the same video on SyncTV, the server needs to handle significant network load. This is where P2P comes in handy.

## How to Use P2P

SyncTV leverages P2P services provided by [SwarmCloud](https://swarmcloud.net/) to enable P2P video transmission.

SwarmCloud requires no additional configuration - simply register an account on the [SwarmCloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.swarmcloud.net/#/signup?zone=p3&inviter=pyh1670605849%40gmail.com) and add your domain name.
