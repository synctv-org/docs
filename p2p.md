## What is P2P

P2P (Peer-to-Peer) is a network architecture where each node acts as both client and server. In a P2P network, nodes connect directly to each other and share resources like files and computing power without relying on centralized servers.

## Why P2P is Needed

When multiple users are watching the same video on SyncTV, the server needs to handle significant network load. This is where P2P comes in handy.

## How to Use P2P

SyncTV leverages P2P services provided by [SwarmCloud](https://swarmcloud.net/) to enable P2P video transmission.

Simply register an account on [SwarmCloud Dashboard](https://dashboard.swarmcloud.net/#/signup?zone=p3&inviter=pyh1670605849%40gmail.com). If your domain is registered in mainland China, you can use domestic regions; otherwise, use overseas regions like `hk`. Then add your domain.

Then go to the `System Settings` page in SyncTV's `Admin Panel` and change the `Swarm Cloud Region` to your corresponding region, such as `hk`.
